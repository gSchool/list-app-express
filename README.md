# list-app
This is an incredibly simple Node Express application. 

## Install
After cloning into the root directory of the project, install dependencies.
```
npm install
```
Create a .env file with a desired port for the server to listen on.
```
PORT=5000
```

## Usage
package.json has been equipped with two launch scripts.
- **npm start** - to begin listening
- **npm run dev** - to use nodemon, watching for changes to files in the project to relaunch the server upon saving files.
